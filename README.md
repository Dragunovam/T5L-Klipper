# T5L-Klipper
The latest firmware for the T5L1C-based LCD module in the creality CR-200B. The repo https://github.com/juliandroid/DWIN_CR_10s_Pro contained some basic information on the file structure of the compiled firmware for a very similar LCD module (T5UID1), it helped me to recreate the project files for the T5L1C firmware by Creality.
